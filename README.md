TRACK Name- OPEN INNOVATION

PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
                Traditional construction methods often lead to cost overruns, delays, and wasted materials, exacerbated by growing populations and limited space. ​
                Clients and architects face difficulties in selecting the right resources and managing their availability, which adds to the complexity. ​
                These challenges not only reduce efficiency but also contribute to global warming and environmental impact.​


  INTRODUCTION:-
              1)Our AI-driven platform is designed to solve long-standing construction issues like rising costs, delays, and material waste.​

              2)Using advanced algorithms and predictive analytics, it optimizes everything from planning to final construction.​

              3)The platform offers real-time collaboration, predictive budgeting, and efficient resource management to keep projects on schedule and within budget.​

              4)By incorporating the latest AI technology, we help make better decisions, reduce waste, promote sustainability, and deliver high-quality construction 
               projects that are cost-effective and environmentally friendly.​
